				ONNX Runtime provides high performance for running deep learning models on a range of
				hardwares. Based on usage scenario requirements, latency, throughput, memory utilization,
				and model/application size are common dimensions for how performance is measured. 
        <br/><br/>
        While ORT
				out-of-box aims to provide good performance for the most common usage patterns, there are
				model optimization techniques and runtime configurations that can be utilized to improve
				performance for specific use cases and models..
